[Question 5] If you are to start a software company, name 2 people from your batch whom you will choose as your partner and why?


If I were to start a software company I would to choose my batchmate Teja.
Teja have a profound coding knowledge and technical acumen, as I have worked with him in a number of projects during my course of engineering, I have seen his technical capabilities and his problem solving skills.
Many times he fixed the bug in our project code in a short span and also he is capable of guiding and leading a team

Another person that I would like to take as partner is Manu, Manu is a childhood friend of me.
He is a BCom graduate. He is having innate ability to cmmunicate and get the work done. His communication and business skills remains unparalled. His business skills would help me to attract clients and sell products.

No software can be successfull without right business strategies. Manu would be able to handle this and take take of legal issues, taxation and other process involved in startig a software company.Teja would take care of establishing developers team and build product. So I choose both of them in my company as partners
