Describe the best project you have worked on, including links if any.


Hi I am a computer science graduate from CMR Institute of Technology, Bengaluru.

I initially explored android development using flutter, data analysis but I found my passion for frontend developement and have built a number of projects using both VanillaJS and ReactJs
